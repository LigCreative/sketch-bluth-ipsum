	"Bob Loblaw Law Blog. Uncle Gob, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant. Yeah, sure, dozens of times. So you take your mom to work every day. Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh. It's, like, die already. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live. Let me out that Queen. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed.",
	"I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest. I'll never forget your wedding. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars.",
	"In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive.",
	"Okay, Lindsay, are you forgetting that I was a professional twice over - an analyst and a therapist. The world's first analrapist. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts.  But I didn't take wasn't optimistic it could be done for an answer. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take \"wasn't optimistic it could be done\" for an answer. Chickens don't clap. Heart attack never stopped old big bear.",
	"You're losing blood, aren't you. Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest. I'll never forget your wedding. Everybody dance… NOW. You stay on top of her Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. Excuse me while I circumvent you. The old reach-around. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.",
	"It's hard to gauge time. Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on. Quicken. Premiere.",
	"Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. Come on. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. We need a name. Maybe \"Operation Hot Mother.\" No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) Why are you squeezing me with your body. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Oh please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. Why are you squeezing me with your body. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto.",
	"I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball. The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad.",
	"George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the \"OC Disorder.\" Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'.",
	"Interfere. I ought to pull down your pants and spank your ass raw. Michael: I'm sorry, have we met. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. I made a huge tiny mistake. Nellie is blowing them all AWAY. I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law.",
	"Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. Chickens don't clap. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. Monday morning. Come on."
